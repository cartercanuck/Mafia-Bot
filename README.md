# Mafia-Bot
Mafia (game) java discord bot

Goal of this project was to create a system to replace the game master (dealer). This later developed into the project you see here, a java based discord bot. This was a solo project that took place during my first semester of software engineering, so the code can very much be improved and cleaned up. The project was overall a success as the bot is able to fully run the game, from start to finish. The bot can run custom game modes, or completely random matches.
