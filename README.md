# Mafia-Bot
Mafia (game) java discord bot

Goal of this project was to create a system to replace the game master (dealer). This later developed into the project you see here, a java based discord bot. This was a solo project that took place during my first semester of software engineering, so the code can very much be improved and cleaned up. The project was overall a success as the bot is able to fully run the game, from start to finish. The bot can run custom game modes, or completely random matches. 

Files have been updated to a new version. This version has recieved a lot of polish compared to the pervious version. It also includes some new features.
